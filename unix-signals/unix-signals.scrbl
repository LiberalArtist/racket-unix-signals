This library provides a means of sending and receiving Unix signals to
Racket programs.

@(define unsafe
   @tech[#:doc '(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]{unsafe})

@bold{Be warned} that attempting to receive certain signals used by the
Racket runtime is @|unsafe|, as the code here will conflict with the
code in Racket itself.

@section{Waiting for a signal}

To receive Unix signals using this library, call
@racket[capture-signal!] once for each signal of interest, and then
use @racket[next-signal-evt] or @racket[read-signal]. Use
@racket[ignore-signal!] and @racket[release-signal!] to ignore a
signal (@tt{SIG_IGN}) or to install the default
signal-handler (@tt{SIG_DFL}), respectively.

@racketblock[
(require unix-signals)
(capture-signal! 'SIGUSR1)
(capture-signal! 'SIGUSR2)
(printf "Try 'kill -USR1 ~a' and 'kill -USR2 ~a'\n" (getpid) (getpid))
(let loop ()
  (define signum (read-signal))
  (printf "Received signal ~v (name ~v)\n" signum (lookup-signal-name signum))
  (loop))]

Calls to @racket[capture-signal!] and friends have @emph{global} effect
within the Racket process. Likewise, use of @racket[next-signal-evt]
and @racket[read-signal] have global side-effects on the state of the
Racket process.

@defproc[(capture-signal! [sig (or/c fixnum? symbol?)]) boolean?]{
Installs a signal handler for the given signal. When the given signal
is received by the process, its signal number will be returned by uses
of @racket[next-signal-evt] and/or @racket[read-signal].

 Note that this function is @|unsafe|:
 it can corrupt or crash the Racket runtime system.
}

@defproc[(ignore-signal! [sig (or/c fixnum? symbol?)]) boolean?]{
 Causes the given signal to be ignored (@tt{SIG_IGN}) by the process.

 Note that this function is @|unsafe|:
 it can corrupt or crash the Racket runtime system.
}

@defproc[(release-signal! [sig (or/c fixnum? symbol?)]) boolean?]{
 Installs the default handler (@tt{SIG_DFL}) for the given signal.

 Note that this function is @|unsafe|:
 it can corrupt or crash the Racket runtime system.
}

@defthing[next-signal-evt evt?]{ @tech[#:doc
'(lib "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]{Synchronizable event} which
becomes ready when a signal previously registered with
@racket[capture-signal!] is received, at which point it returns the
number of the received signal as its synchronization result by
yielding the result of a call to @racket[read-signal]. }

@defproc[(read-signal) fixnum?]{ Blocks until a signal previously
registered with @racket[capture-signal!] is received. Returns the
number of the received signal. Signals are buffered internally using
the @link["http://cr.yp.to/docs/selfpipe.html"]{self-pipe trick}, and
are therefore delivered in order of receipt. }

@section{Sending a signal}

@defproc[(send-signal! [pid fixnum?] [sig (or/c fixnum? symbol?)])
boolean?]{ Calls @tt{kill(2)} to deliver the given signal to the
given process ID. All special cases for @racket[pid] from the
@tt{kill(2)} manpage apply.

 Note that this function is @|unsafe|:
 it can corrupt or crash the Racket runtime system.

 For convenience, this library also re-exports
 @racket[getpid] from @racketmodname[racket/os].
}

@section{Mapping between signal names and signal numbers}

@defproc[(lookup-signal-number [sym symbol?]) (opt/c fixnum?)]{
Returns a fixnum if the symbol name is defined, or @racket[#f] if not. }

@defproc[(lookup-signal-name [num fixnum?]) (opt/c symbol?)]{ Returns
a symbol naming the given signal number, if one is defined, or
@racket[#f] if not. Note that in cases where multiple C identifiers
map to a given signal number, an arbitrary choice among the
possibilities is returned. }
